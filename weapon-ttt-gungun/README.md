# The Gun Gun [TTT]
A gun that shoots guns that shoot... because more bullets is more better.

The Gun Gun is a cannon that releases floating firearms. Every time you release a firearm a random CS:S weapon is deployed and fires its respective rounds for 30 seconds, then breaks. Sounds and damages are accurate to CS:S.

Perfect for controlling crowds, creating diversions, or causing chaos/panic/mayhem.
